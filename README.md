# Awesome Conduct

> Be Truly Awesome

## What is this ?

Awesome Conduct is a guide for being AWESOME.
It's also an incredible reference to find that you probably did something wrong.

**Disclaimer**: This awesome-guide was made for people who recognize their own mistakes. If you are already awesome, you can save your time and stop right here.


## Why?

There has always been prejudiced attitudes among the developer communities. But only now developers are joining forces to overcome all prejudice and invest in a community that is healthy and inclusive.

**Understand**: Racism, sexism, homophobia, or any other kinds of prejudice are not acceptable in a healthy community. **Everyone is equal** and has equal voice power.

One of the preventive measures against this inequality and prejudice is the Code of Conduct.

#### What's a Code of Conduct

>A code of conduct is a set of rules outlining the social norms and rules and responsibilities of, or proper practices for, an individual, party or organization. Related concepts include ethical, honor, moral codes and religious laws. *Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_conduct)*
